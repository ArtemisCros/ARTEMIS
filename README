ARTEMIS is a network scheduling simulation tool. It is designed to modelize network flows and topologies and to establish a graphical scheduling representation of a given network.

Different options in the modules also allows the user to implement successive simulations for benchmarking purposes.

    INSTALLATION
###################### 
ARTEMIS do not require to be installed. Each jar module can be run independantly. Basically, ARTEMIS core contains 4 modules 

Each module run is based on a simid. A simid is the id of the current simulation. It corresponds to the folder name we can find in ressources/ folder. For each simulation, a ressources/<simid>/ folder has to be created.

Parameters between || are optional.

artemis_topology : Network topology generator
Usage : java -jar artemis_topology.jar <simid> |<networksize>|

artemis_messages : mixed critical flows generator
Usage : java -jar artemis_messages.jar <simid> |<critRate>| |<autoload>|

artemis_launcher : core simulator
Usage : java -jar artemis_launcher.jar <simid>
This simulation cannot be run without a config.xml, messages.xml and network.xml in ressources/<simid>/input/ folder.

artemis_grapher : Graph builder from xml simulation files
Usage : java -jar artemis_grapher.jar <simid>

    DETAILS
######################
ARTEMIS is based on the content of the /ressources folder, which contains all the input and output informations required and generated by the tool.

/ressources/input : input files
config.xml : Global configuration. This file has to be manually edited. It contains all the simulation informations : time limit, WCAT generation models, Criticality switches detection, ...

/ressources/gen : generated files
These files correspond to the description of the scheduling simulation itself. These are all XML/PNG files describing the simulation.
